Build a sophisticated **Affiliate Marketing Analytics Platform** that caters to both **content creators (e.g., influencers, bloggers)** and **brands (e.g., merchants, advertisers)**. The platform will provide real-time analytics with robust stream processing to track and optimize affiliate marketing campaigns. Key features include **real-time event tracking**, **30-day attribution windows**, **unique affiliate link identifiers (LinkAttrID)**, **real-time dashboards**, **data backup to S3**, and **seamless integrations** with popular affiliate networks and platforms.

The platform will consist of:
1. **Real-time data stream processing** and **analytics** pipelines.
2. **Event-driven architecture** to track and report affiliate link performance.
3. **Attribution models** and robust tracking of affiliate interactions for accurate performance metrics.

### **Key Features & Functionalities:**

#### 1. **Real-Time Stream Processing:**
   - **Event Streams:**
     - Data will be streamed in real-time via **Apache Kafka** (or **AWS Kinesis**), capturing events such as **clicks**, **conversions**, and **purchases** for each affiliate link.
     - Each event will contain a unique identifier, **LinkAttrID**, which links back to a specific affiliate or campaign.

   - **Stream Processing:**
     - Use **Apache Flink** or **Google Dataflow** for real-time event processing, including aggregations and calculations of key metrics such as:
       - **Click-through rates (CTR)**
       - **Conversion rates**
       - **Earnings per click (EPC)**
       - **Revenue per sale (RPS)**
     - The data will be processed by **LinkAttrID** for detailed reporting per affiliate link.

#### 2. **Attribution Window (30 Days):**
   - **Attribution Logic:**
     - Each **affiliate conversion** will be attributed to the content creator or affiliate who provided the **LinkAttrID** within a **30-day attribution window**.
     - Multiple clicks from the same user within the 30-day period will be tracked and the system will apply the **last-click attribution model** by default. However, support for **first-click** or **linear attribution** models will also be included.
     - **Multi-click attribution**: For users who interact with multiple affiliate links, the system will attribute conversions based on the selected model.

   - **Attribution Reports:**
     - Display **conversion counts** and **revenue generation** for each **LinkAttrID** based on the 30-day window, providing both content creators and brands with accurate, up-to-date insights.

#### 3. **Affiliate Link & Campaign Tracking (LinkAttrID):**
   - **Unique Link Tracking:**
     - Each **affiliate link** will have a unique **LinkAttrID** that tracks the origin, interactions, and performance of the link across multiple campaigns and content creators.
     - Content creators will be able to track performance at the **LinkAttrID level**, allowing them to understand how specific links perform over time.

   - **Link Performance Metrics:**
     - For each **LinkAttrID**, the following metrics will be captured:
       - **Clicks**, **impressions**, and **conversions**.
       - **Revenue generation** and **commission earned** by the content creator.
       - **Earnings per Click (EPC)** and **conversion rates**.

#### 4. **Data Backup to S3:**
   - **Raw Event Data Storage:**
     - All raw event data (clicks, conversions, purchases) captured by **Apache Kafka** will be backed up to **Amazon S3** before further processing to ensure data durability and reliability.
     - Data will be stored in **timestamped folders** in S3, segregated by **LinkAttrID** and **event type** (clicks, conversions, etc.).

   - **Backup Integrity:**
     - Data validation checks will be performed to ensure the integrity of the raw data stored in S3 before it is processed further.
     - If stream processing fails or needs to be replayed, the raw data can be retrieved from S3.

   - **Data Flow:**
     - Processed data will be transferred from **S3** to a **data warehouse** (e.g., **Amazon Redshift**, **Google BigQuery**, or **Snowflake**) for deeper analytics and historical reporting.

#### 5. **Analytics and Reporting:**
   - **Real-Time Dashboards:**
     - Content creators and brands will have access to personalized dashboards where they can view real-time performance data:
       - **Content Creator Dashboard:** Track **clicks**, **conversions**, **revenue**, **EPC**, and other affiliate metrics for each **LinkAttrID**.
       - **Brand Dashboard:** View aggregated performance across multiple content creators, showing total **clicks**, **conversions**, **revenue**, and **ROI** per campaign or **LinkAttrID**.
     - Dashboards will display trends, top-performing links, and forecasted revenue based on historical data.

   - **Campaign-Level Analytics:**
     - **Campaign Performance:** Brands can track performance for specific campaigns, analyzing how different content creators contribute to the campaign’s success.
     - Breakdown by **LinkAttrID**: View performance for each affiliate link across multiple campaigns.

   - **Advanced Analytics:**
     - **Predictive analytics** using machine learning to forecast potential revenue based on current campaign trends.
     - **A/B testing** capabilities for comparing the effectiveness of different campaigns, affiliate links, or content creators.

   - **Time-Window Metrics:**
     - Content creators and brands will be able to select time windows (e.g., **past 7 days**, **past 30 days**) for their reports and compare performance across different periods.

#### 6. **Integration with Affiliate Networks & Platforms:**
   - **Affiliate Networks Integration:**
     - Integrate with major affiliate networks like **ShareASale**, **CJ Affiliate**, **Rakuten**, and **Amazon Associates** to pull data on affiliate transactions and earnings via their APIs.
     - APIs will handle the data ingestion, allowing for seamless tracking of affiliate link performance.

   - **eCommerce Platform Integration:**
     - The system will integrate with eCommerce platforms like **Shopify**, **WooCommerce**, and **Magento** to capture transaction data in real-time.

#### 7. **Notifications & Alerts:**
   - **Alerting System:**
     - Set up automated alerts for content creators and brands based on specific conditions (e.g., earnings drop below a threshold, underperforming campaigns).
     - Real-time notifications can be sent through **Slack**, **SMS**, or **email** when critical metrics reach certain thresholds.

   - **Performance Triggers:**
     - Alerts can be configured for:
       - Low-performing affiliate links.
       - High-converting campaigns.
       - Specific time-based milestones (e.g., clicks in the last 24 hours).

#### 8. **Security & Data Privacy:**
   - **Data Encryption:**
     - Data backed up to **S3** and transferred to the data warehouse will be encrypted using **AWS KMS** or **AES-256** encryption.
     - Ensure compliance with **GDPR** and other data privacy laws through secure data access protocols and user permissions.

   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
     - The platform will support RBAC to control data access. Different user roles (e.g., admin, brand manager, content creator) will have varying levels of access to performance metrics and historical data.
