**Objective:**  

Develop a production-grade software component that adheres to industry best practices and embodies the principles of **microservices** or **distributed systems**. The solution should be designed for **real-world deployment** with consideration for maintainability, performance, and scaling.

**Requirements:**  z



1. **Code Quality & Standards:**  

   - Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.  

   - Follow industry coding standards (e.g., SOLID principles, DRY, KISS).  

   - Implement comprehensive unit tests with >90% code coverage.  



2. **Microservice/Distributed Architecture:**  

   - Ensure loose coupling and high cohesion.  

   - Use a stateless design where applicable.  

   - Define clear APIs with consistent and versioned endpoints (e.g., REST, GraphQL, gRPC).  



3. **Key Architectural Principles:**  

   - **Consistency:** Guarantee data consistency using distributed patterns (e.g., eventual consistency, CAP theorem).  

   - **Autonomy:** Ensure the service is self-contained and independently deployable.  

   - **High Availability:** Incorporate fault-tolerant mechanisms (e.g., retries, circuit breakers).  



4. **Performance & Scalability:**  

   - Design for horizontal scalability.  

   - Optimize for performance under high concurrency (e.g., asynchronous processing, caching).  



5. **Security:**  

   - Enforce security best practices (e.g., encryption, authentication, and authorization).  

   - Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, mTLS).  

   - Protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).  



6. **Integration & Observability:**  

   - Implement logging and distributed tracing (e.g., using OpenTelemetry).  

   - Enable seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines.  

   - Provide robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms.  



7. **Maintainability:**  

   - Write code that is easy to extend and refactor.  

   - Include clear documentation for setup, usage, and deployment.  



8. **Reliability:**  

   - Include automated test cases for edge scenarios and failure handling.  

   - Simulate and handle transient failures gracefully.

**Deliverables:**  

- Source code in a public or private repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).  

- Documentation explaining the design, usage, and architectural decisions.  

- A suite of tests covering functionality and edge cases.  

- Deployment instructions or scripts (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).  



**Evaluation Criteria:**  

- Code quality and adherence to standards.  

- Correctness and completeness of functionality.  

- Scalability, reliability, and security considerations.  

- Ease of integration and deployment.  

- Performance under simulated production loads.
